Manager Login
```````````````
Username: josnoble113@gmail.com
Password: password

---------------
The first user to login to the system, will be the manager and will have
a manager and login account created (in this case, I will provide a
predetermined username and password). Once the manager logins into the 
system, then they are able to create a full coach account and store it 
inside the coach details database table. A coach login account is also 
created. The coach can then create a full member account and store it 
inside the member details database table. A member login account is 
then created, allowing all users access to the system.
